Over the years, I have contributed to a wide variety of projects across diverse environments and technologies. My experience includes:

* Serving as a developer, lead developer, and Unity instructor
* Working in small startups and as a solo developer
* Taking on roles in R&D, gameplay development, and tool development
* Participating in LiveOps games and prototyping new games
* Developing for web, desktop, and mobile/AR platforms

I began my career in Facebook game development. After several years, I partnered with a game designer to develop a prototype for an indie 3D racing game in Unity. Unfortunately, due to insufficient funding, this prototype did not progress to a full release. However, this experience led me to the creation of Unity assets.

Under the name ToolBuddy, I publish Unity assets covering various areas such as automatic code optimization and procedural 3D model generation. These assets achieve an average rating of 4.8 out of 5. I also work as a freelancer in game and tool development, and teach Unity game development at ISART Digital Paris.
